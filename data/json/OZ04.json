	"Quote": "The marriage rule observed by the mass of the people was one wife at one time, but chiefs sometimes exercised the privileges of rank and wealth by having more than one. Thus, monogamy or more accurately monogyny (one wife) was the general rule and polygamy or polygyny (plural wives) was much less common.",
